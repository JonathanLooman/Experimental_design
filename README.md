# Experimental_design
This repository is of useful statistical tests and models when conducting experimental design. This work is the building block for a further project looking to A/B test for starbucks. \
These excersises were done as part of the Udacity Data Science Nano Degree, which I did to refresh my data science knowledge between finishing my masters degree and starting my first data science job. I have placed them here as a reference for myself and other data scientists wanting to perform statistical tests in python.
